# Home_Environment_simulation
Home Environment simulation - Part of my Intelligent Adaptive Systems module for 3rd year - BSc Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence)) - Achieved 36/40

The assignement - Albeit confusing and last minute, was to create a visualised simulation (i chose to make a text based simulation) Of a 1 room airbnb, where you could manage the Tempterature, and humidity of the room, in order to optimise the inhabitants "Satisfaction" Levels. All we were provided was a ruleset, and 3 datasets:

- Original training data, 1 month worth of timesteps. (6com2007-3.csv)
- Dataset with the window open. (Windows_open.csv)
- Test Data. (New_day.csv)
- The Python file includes the neural network used to create a model that can predict the satisfaction of an inhabitant given their environmental circumstances.
- cw2.docx Includes my report and findings, including reasonds for decisions made along the way
